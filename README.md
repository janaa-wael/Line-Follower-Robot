# Line-Follower-Robot-Project

This project was developed as part of the **Digital Twin course at Siemens Academy**. It implements a differential‑drive line-following robot using the **Innexis Virtual System Interconnect (VSI)** fabric. Three independent Python clients communicate over a CAN‑like bus to simulate the robot, compute PID control, and visualize the trajectory in real time.

The system is designed to study PID tuning, path tracking, and robustness under noise. All experiments (gain sweep, curved path, noise rejection, PD vs PID) are driven by environment variables — no code changes are required.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Innexis VSI** installed and properly licensed (provided by Siemens Academy)
- Python 3.8+ with the following packages:
  - `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pyqtgraph`, `PyQt6` (or `PySide6`

### 1. Generate the VSI System

First, create the digital twin using `vsiBuild`. This generates the `lineFollowerDemo` folder with all necessary C++ wrappers and the `FabricServer`.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/src
vsiBuild -f vsiBuildCommands
cd lineFollowerDemo
```

### 2. Run the Simulation

You need **four terminals** (or tabs). In each, navigate to the `lineFollowerDemo` folder.

| Terminal           | Command                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1 – Server**     | `./FabricServer`                                             |
| **2 – Simulator**  | `export PATH_TYPE=0 NOISE_LEVEL=0.0; python3 src/simulator/simulator.py` |
| **3 – Controller** | `export KP_LATERAL=2.0 KI_LATERAL=0.15 KD_LATERAL=0.3 KP_HEADING=1.5; python3 src/controller/controller.py` |
| **4 – Plotter**    | `python3 src/plotter/plotter.py --save`                      |

The plotter window will open (if X11 is enabled) and the simulation will run for 60 seconds. After completion, CSV, PNG, and JSON files are saved in `results/`.

## 🧪 Experiments

All experiments are controlled by **environment variables**. Change them in the respective terminals and restart the simulation.

### E1 – PID Gain Sweep

Set the four gain variables in **Terminal 3** to different values. Example gain sets:

| Set          | KP_LATERAL | KI_LATERAL | KD_LATERAL | KP_HEADING |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Conservative | 0.5        | 0.05       | 0.1        | 0.4        |
| Moderate     | 1.0        | 0.1        | 0.2        | 0.8        |
| Balanced     | 2.0        | 0.15       | 0.3        | 1.5        |
| Aggressive   | 3.0        | 0.2        | 0.4        | 2.2        |
| High D       | 1.5        | 0.1        | 0.8        | 1.2        |

### E2 – Curved Path

In **Terminal 2**, set `PATH_TYPE=1` (curved sine wave). Use the best gains from E1.

### E3 – Noise Rejection

In **Terminal 2**, set `NOISE_LEVEL` to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc. Keep the best gains.

### E4 – PD vs PID

- **PID**: use a set with `KI_LATERAL > 0`.
- **PD**: set `KI_LATERAL=0` in Terminal 3.
